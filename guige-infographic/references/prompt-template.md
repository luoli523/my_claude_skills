## Gui Ge Character Reference

Use the bundled reference image as the character/style anchor. Integrate a recurring Q-style Gui Ge narrator:

- sleepy half-lidded eyes
- mildly sarcastic / 吐槽 expression
- orange headband with the Chinese text "鬼哥"
- blue hoodie
- acoustic guitar as signature prop
- cute, efficient cartoon style with a clean readable silhouette and expressive face
- adapt Japanese manga-style expression effects to the content when useful: sweat drop, surprise lines, angry vein mark, speech bubble, speed lines, sparkle eyes, deadpan face, tiny chibi reaction sticker
- match expressions to meaning: surprise for key insights, sweat drop for risks, sparkle for opportunities, deadpan for product friction, speed lines for action items
- appears as a narrator, sticker, pointer, or callout host
- supports the content hierarchy and must not dominate the page
